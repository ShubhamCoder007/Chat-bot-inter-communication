# Chat-bot-inter-communication
Plane implementation of python and the bag of words model of Natural Language Processing. In the project two bots have been created which are the objects from bot factory class and they communicate with each other. This is a very primitive and limited approach. I'll update and advance it letter using reinforcement learning and NLP. Any commits would be appreciated.
